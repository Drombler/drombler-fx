  "body": "The modular application framework for *JavaFX* based on:\r\n\r\n - **OSGi**: *OSGi* is the de facto standard for writing modular software in *Java*.\r\n\r\n - **Maven (POM-first)**: *Drombler FX* applications can be build with *Maven*. The build follows the standard POM-first approach (the OSGi meta data will be generated for you). A custom Maven Plugin will help you to easily create *JavaFX* applications with Maven. A custom Maven Archetype will help you to get started.\r\n\r\n- **Declarative programming model**: Annotations can be used at many places to register elements such as menus, toolbars and GUI components.\r\n\r\n- **Drombler ACP**: *Drombler FX* is a *JavaFX* specific extension for *Drombler ACP* providing *JavaFX*-based implementations for the abstract definitions. Read more about *Drombler ACP* here: [Drombler ACP](../drombler-acp)\r\n\r\n- **Drombler Commons**: *Drombler Commons* is a collection of reusable libraries and frameworks. They ship with *OSGi* meta data but donâ€™t require an *OSGi* environment. Read more about *Drombler Commons* here: [Drombler Commons](../drombler-commons)\r\n\r\n*Drombler FX* uses [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org) as its OSGi container by default.\r\n\r\nAs an application framework it makes sure *JavaFX* and *OSGi* will get started properly and it provides the main window.\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\n- [v0.8-SNAPSHOT](0.8-SNAPSHOT)\r\n- [v0.7](0.7)\r\n- [v0.6](0.6)\r\n- [v0.5](0.5)\r\n- [v0.4](0.4)\r\n- [v0.3](0.3)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Florian Brunner (@puce77)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck out the documentation at http://www.drombler.org/drombler-fx/current/docs or ask questions at [StackOverflow using the drombler-fx tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/drombler-fx).\r\n\r\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Drombler/drombler-fx.svg)](https://gitter.im/Drombler/drombler-fx?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\r\n",

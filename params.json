{"name":"Drombler FX","tagline":"The modular application framework for JavaFX.","body":"The modular application framework for *JavaFX* based on:\r\n\r\n - **OSGi**: *OSGi* is the de facto standard for writing modular software in *Java*.\r\n\r\n - **Maven (POM-first)**: *Drombler FX* applications can be build with *Maven*. The build follows the standard POM-first approach (the OSGi meta data will be generated for you). A custom Maven Plugin will help you to easily create *JavaFX* applications with Maven. A custom Maven Archetype will help you to get started.\r\n\r\n- **Declarative programming model**: Annotations can be used at many places to register elements such as menus, toolbars and GUI components.\r\n\r\n- **Drombler ACP**: *Drombler FX* is a *JavaFX* specific extension for *Drombler ACP* providing *JavaFX*-based implementations for the abstract definitions. Read more about *Drombler ACP* here: [Drombler ACP](https://github.com/Drombler/drombler-acp)\r\n\r\n- **Drombler Commons**: *Drombler Commons* is a collection of reusable libraries and frameworks. They ship with *OSGi* meta data but donâ€™t require an *OSGi* environment. Read more about *Drombler Commons* here: [Drombler Commons](https://github.com/Drombler/drombler-commons)\r\n\r\n*Drombler FX* uses [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org) as its OSGi container by default.\r\n\r\nAs an application framework it makes sure *JavaFX* and *OSGi* will get started properly and it provides the main window.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Florian Brunner (@puce77)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck out the documentation at https://www.drombler.org/drombler-fx/current/docs or contact @puce77 directly.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

The _application layout_ defines the general layout of your application.

As there is no one-size-fits-all solution, the application layout is pluggable so you can provide your own 
implementation tailored to your needs. This allows you to get the most out of _Drombler FX_ and _JavaFX_.

== Pluggable Application Layout
There are two _OSGi_ service interfaces to customize the application layout:
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-fx/{drombler-fx-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/fx/core/application/MainSceneRootProvider.html[MainSceneRootProvider]
and
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-fx/{drombler-fx-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/fx/core/application/ApplicationContentProvider.html[ApplicationContentProvider]

The _MainSceneRootProvider_ service interface provides the root parent node of the main scene. This root parent node can define the basic application layout.
To make such an application layout more reusable it's recommended to get the main application content from an _ApplicationContentProvider_.
See <<standardDesktopClassicLayout,Standard Desktop Classic Layout>> for a sample.

If you're replacing the _Standard Desktop Classic Layout_ with a custom layout, which also supports the _Action Framework_, consider to add
the Exit action:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.drombler.fx</groupId>
    <artifactId>drombler-fx-core-standard-action</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----
[IMPORTANT]
====
This action requires a registered menu with id "File" to be shown in the File menu. This is usually provided at application level e.g. using the following runtime dependency: +
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.drombler.acp</groupId>
    <artifactId>drombler-acp-core-standard-action</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>  
----
====

The _ApplicationContentProvider_ service interface provides the application content node. 
An ApplicationContentProvider can be used by several _MainSceneRootProvider_ service implementations.
See <<docking-framework.adoc#activation,Docking Framework>> for a sample.

TIP: If you're replacing the _Docking Framework_ with a custom _ApplicationContentProvider_, also consider to provide a service implementation for the following service interface:
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-fx/{drombler-fx-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/fx/core/application/OnExitRequestHandlerProvider.html[OnExitRequestHandlerProvider]
e.g. to make sure the users of your application don't loose accidentally any unsaved data.

The distinction between _MainSceneRootProvider_ and _ApplicationContentProvider_ makes both of them more reusable, e.g.:

 * if you like the _Standard Desktop Classic Layout_ but the _Docking Framework_ doesn't fit your needs: still use the _Standard Desktop Classic Layout_
   but provide a custom implementation of the _ApplicationContentProvider_ service interface. It will be picked up by the _Standard Desktop Classic Layout_
   automatically. (Omit the _Docking Framework_ dependencies!)
 * if you like the _Docking Framework_ but you would prefer a different application layout: still use the _ApplicationContentProvider_ 
   service implementation provided by the _Docking Framework_ but provide a custom implementation of the _MainSceneRootProvider_ service interface which 
   also supports the _ApplicationContentProvider_ service interface.
 * if neither the _Standard Desktop Classic Layout_ nor the _Docking Framework_ does fit your needs: at least provide a custom implementation of the _MainSceneRootProvider_ service interface.
   To make the application layout more reusable provide the main application content with a custom _ApplicationContentProvider_ service implementation from a different OSGi bundle
   but this is optional and not required.

== Standard Desktop Classic Layout
The _Standard Desktop Classic Layout_ provides a layout which is often used in classic desktop applications.

To activate the _Standard Desktop Classic Layout_ you need the following optional runtime dependency:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.drombler.fx</groupId>
    <artifactId>drombler-fx-core-standard-desktop-classic</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>

This section describes an initial version of a _Docking Framework_.

[[activation]]
== Activation
To activate the Docking Framework in your application add the following runtime dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <!--  Provides JavaFX based implementations of the Docking Framework 
          You could omit this dependency as long as it is a transitive dependency. -->
    <groupId>org.drombler.fx</groupId>
    <artifactId>drombler-fx-core-docking</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This dependency will provide an implementation of the
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-fx/{drombler-fx-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/fx/core/application/ApplicationContentProvider.html[ApplicationContentProvider]
service interface. So in addition to this dependency you need an <<application-layout.adoc#applicationLayout,Application Layout>>, which supports the _ApplicationContentProvider_ service interface
such as the <<application-layout.adoc#standardDesktopClassicLayout,Standard Desktop Classic Layout>>.
====

[NOTE]
====
The _Docking Framework_ also provides an implementation of the
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-fx/{drombler-fx-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/fx/core/application/OnExitRequestHandlerProvider.html[OnExitRequestHandlerProvider]
service interface, which helps prevent loosing any unsaved data.
====

== Docking Areas

The _Docking Framework_ splits up the content area into any number of _Docking Areas_. The _Docking Areas_ can be resized using the dividers. Each _Docking Area_ can hold any number of 
_Dockable Panes_, which are layed out as Tabs. 

=== Registering Docking Areas

_Docking Areas_ can be registered using the http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/DockingArea.html[@DockingArea] and 
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/LayoutConstraints.html[@LayoutConstraints] annotations on a package (usually in 
_package-info.java_):

[cols="1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Property | Value

|id | the ID of the _Docking Area_. This ID can be used when registering _Dockable Panes_ (see further down)
|kind | the kind of the _Docking Area_.
|position | the position in the parent split pane. It's a best practice to leave out some positions between entries to 
allow other bundles to register entries between some existing ones.

entries to allow other bundles to register entries between some existing ones.
|permanent | if true, visible also when empty, else only visible if not empty
|layoutConstraints | the layout constraints (see further down)

The http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/LayoutConstraints.html[@LayoutConstraints] properties:

[cols="1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Property | Value

|prefWidth | the preferred width of the _Docking Area_. Can be negative to indicate a flexible width (default).
|prefHeight | the preferred height of the _Docking Area_. Can be negative to indicate a flexible height (default).

The next section covers these properties in further detail explaining the standard _Docking Areas_ provided by _Drombler FX_.

=== Standard Docking Areas provided by Drombler FX

_Drombler FX_ provides 5 _Docking Areas_ out-of-the-box: **left**, **right**, **top**, **bottom** and **editor**. 
The left, right, top and bottom areas have been configured to be visible only if they contain any docked _Dockable Pane_. They have been configured as 
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-commons/{drombler-commons-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/commons/docking/DockingAreaKind.html#VIEW[VIEW] Docking Areas and thus are intended for 
view Dockables.
The editor area has been configured to be always visible, even if it's empty. It has been configured as 
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-commons/{drombler-commons-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/commons/docking/DockingAreaKind.html#EDITOR[EDITOR] Docking Area and is thus the default 
Docking Area for editor Dockables.

image::docking/docking-areas-tutorial.png[caption="Image 1: ", title="Standard Docking Areas", alt="Standard Docking Areas", link="{imagesdir}/docking/docking-areas-tutorial.png"]

As the image illustrates e.g. for the _Docking Area_ "right", the path {20, 80} and position 20 are interpreted as:

 * The parent of the _Docking Area_ is located at:
     . Start with a vertically splitted pane.
     . At path position 20 of this vertically splitted pane, add a horizontally splitted pane
     . At path position 80 of this horizontally splitted pane, add a vertically splitted pane (= parent of the _Docking Area_, as the end of the path {20, 80} has been reached)

-> an even number of path positions creates a vertically splitted pane, an odd number of path positions creates a horizontally splitted pane

 * The _Docking Area_ "right" itself is then added to this parent vertically splitted pane at position 20.

Note: To use the standard _Docking Areas_ provided by _Drombler FX_, you need to add a runtime dependency (usually in your drombler-fx-application project) to: org.drombler.acp:drombler-acp-core-standard-docking

== Dockable Panes

In _Drombler FX_ applications you don't design the whole application window, as this is managed by _Drombler FX_. Instead you design _Dockable Panes_, which are docked as tabs to _Docking Areas_.

_Dockable Panes_ can extend from any Node such as layout panes.

Currently, there are 2 kinds of _Dockable Panes_: views and editors.

=== View Dockable Panes

_View Dockable Panes_ are typically used to show or select some data.

_Views_ are singletons: only one instance per type is used in the application.

_Drombler FX_ provides a "Window" menu and requires each view to register a menu item, which can be used to open the view. The menu item implementation is provided by _Drombler FX_.

_Drombler FX_ also provides the "Window" sub-menu "Other" out-of-the-box.

A _Dockable Pane_ can be registered as a _view_ using the http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/ViewDocking.html[@ViewDocking] and 
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/WindowMenuEntry.html[@WindowMenuEntry] annotations:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/tutorial/docking/DockableView.java[lines=18..24]
----

http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/ViewDocking.html[@ViewDocking] has the following properties:

[cols="1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Property | Value

|areaId | the ID of the _Dockable Area_ this _Dockable Pane_ should be registered to (see above for further information)
|position | the (tab) position in the parent _Dockable Area_. It's a best practice to leave out some positions between 
entries to allow other bundles to register entries between some existing ones.
|displayName | the text to be used as the title of the _Dockable Pane_ and as the text of the registered menu item. 
If the value starts with '%' the rest of the value is interpreted as a property key and the value gets looked-up in the 
Bundle.properties file (or a locale specific derivation of this file), which has to be in the same package as the 
annotated action. Note: Maven expects resources to be in the resources directory.
|accelerator | the accelerator to open this _Dockable Pane_
|icon | the icon to be used for this _Dockable Pane_. Note that this only specifies the name pattern. _Drombler FX_ 
looks for <icon-base-name>16.<icon-extension> for menu items (expected to be 16x16 pixels). In the example 
above _Drombler FX_ would look for myViewPane16.png. Note: Maven expects resources to be in a resources directory. If 
you're using drombler-fx-parent as your parent POM, it's best to put binary files under the resources-bin directory as 
this directory has been configured not to be filtered for variables.
|state | the initial docking state of this _Dockable Pane_. (This has currently no effect.)
|menuEntry | the menu item registration. (See further down for more information.)
|===

http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/WindowMenuEntry.html[@WindowMenuEntry] has the following properties:

[cols="1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Property | Value

|path | The menu path relative to the Windows menu. See <<actions-menus-toolbars.adoc#actionsMenusToolbars,Actions, Menus and Toolbars>> for more information about menus.
|position | The position of the menu item in its parent menu.
|===

=== Editor Dockable Panes

_Editor Dockable Panes_ are typically used to edit some data, e.g. in a form or a text editor.

To open an editor for a _Data Handler_ call
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/spi/Dockables.html#openEditorForContent-org.softsmithy.lib.util.UniqueKeyProvider-[Dockables.openEditorForContent].


A _Dockable Pane_ can be registered as an _editor_ using the http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/EditorDocking.html[@EditorDocking] annotation:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/tutorial/docking/DockableEditor.java[lines=18..21]
----

@EditorDocking has the following properties:

[cols="1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Property | Value

|contentType | the data handler class
|===

=== Data Support
The _Docking Framework_ registers an implementation of 
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-commons/{drombler-commons-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/commons/data/DataCapabilityProvider.html[DataCapabilityProvider] 
for the 
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-commons/{drombler-commons-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/commons/data/Openable.html[Openable] 
_Data Capability_. It tries to open an _Editor_ for a _Data Handler_ by calling
http://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp/{drombler-acp-version}/docs/site/apidocs/org/drombler/acp/core/docking/spi/Dockables.html#openEditorForContent-java.lang.Object-[Dockables.openEditorForContent].

=== Samples

==== View Sample

The sample code below shows a simple implementation of a _Dockable Pane_ registered as a view:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/tutorial/docking/MyViewPane.java[lines=17..45]
----

Note: The @ViewDocking doesn't specify any values for accelerator or icon here as they are optional.

The easiest way to load a FXML file is to use the _Drombler Commons_ utility method FXMLLoaders.loadRoot(this). 
It expects an FXML and a ResourceBundle file with the same name as the _Dockable Pane_ (here: MyViewPane.fxml and 
MyViewPane.properties) in the same package. It registers the _Dockable Pane_ as root and as controller.

Since the _Dockable Pane_ gets registered as the controller, you can use the JavaFX @FXML annotation to inject controls 
and register method-callbacks.

Since the _Dockable Pane_ gets registered as the root, the FXML is expected to start with "fx:root" and the type should 
be the parent type (here: "GridPane"):

[source,xml]
----
include::{resourcesdir}/tutorial/docking/MyViewPane.fxml[lines=1..13]
----

See <<localization.adoc#localization,Localization>> for more information about localization.

Note: Maven expects resources such as properties-files and FXML-files to be in the resources directory.

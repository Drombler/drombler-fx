== Drombler FX Sample Application - generate, build and run

In this trail we'll generate a _Drombler FX_ sample application, build and run it in 3 simple steps.

=== Create the Application
_Drombler FX_ provides a Maven Archetype to create a simple _Drombler FX_-based sample application:

[source,bash]
----
include::{bashsourcedir}/getting-started/generate-sample.sh[lines=2..2]
----

Note: You can replace groupId, artifactId, version and brandingId as you see fit, of course. But for the rest of this 
section we assume the values as shown above.

=== Build the Application

[source,bash]
----
include::{bashsourcedir}/getting-started/build-sample.sh[lines=2..3]
----

=== Run the Application

To run the application from the command line, you can use either:

[source,bash]
----
include::{bashsourcedir}/getting-started/run1-sample.sh[lines=2..3]
----

or:

[source,bash]
----
include::{bashsourcedir}/getting-started/run2-sample.sh[lines=2..3]
----

or you can just double-click the _my-application.jar_ in the _target/deployment/standalone/bin_ directory.

The _--userdir_ option is quite useful during development. If you omit it, the default location will be used: _${user.home}/.${brandingId}/${project.version}_

== Drombler FX Sample Application - the running application explained
This sample application uses the <<application-layout.adoc#standardDesktopClassicLayout,Standard Desktop Classic Layout>>.

When you start-up the application you should see something like the following:

 * A JavaFX window with a custom title
 * A content pane consisting of four _Views_ (Left, Right, Top and Bottom) around an empty editor area
 * A Menu Bar with the following Menus: File, View, Custom, Window and Help
 * A Toolbar Container with three Toolbars: File, Rectangle and Circle
 * A Status Bar, which shows a progress monitor if there is any worker in the application wide context

image::getting-started/drombler-sample-application.png[caption="Image 1: ", title="Drombler Sample Application - with 2 Sample Editors: 'Sample 1' and 'Some Sample' and 1 Foo Editor: 'Untitled 3'", alt="Drombler Sample Application - with 2 Sample Editors: 'Sample 1' and 'Some Sample' and 1 Foo Editor: 'Untitled 3'", link="{imagesdir}/getting-started/drombler-sample-application.png"]

Let's start with the Content Pane.

=== The Content Pane
What you actually can find here is an initial version of a Docking Framework: The Docking Framework splits up the 
content area into any number of _Docking Areas_. _Drombler FX_ provides 5 Docking Areas out-of-the-box: left, right, 
top, bottom and editor. The _Docking Areas_ can be resized using the dividers. Each _Docking Area_ can hold any number 
of _Dockable Panes_, which are layed out as Tabs. The left, right, top and bottom areas have been configured only to be 
visible if they contain any docked _Dockable Pane_. The editor area has been configured to be always visible.

The Left _Dockable Pane_ has been provided by the sample and is docked to the left _Docking Area_. It contains a button 
to create a new Sample object and open a Sample Editor _Dockable Pane_ in the editor _Docking Area_.

The Sample Editor (opened if you click on the "New Sample" button in the Left _Dockable Pane_) is provided by the sample
 and contains a text field, which is bound to the Tab text of the Sample Editor, and displays the currently selected circle and rectangles.

The Foo Editor (opened if you click on the "File -> New" menu item or open a foo file with "File -> Open" or by passing a foo file path as argument at application start) is provided by the sample
 and contains a text area to display the text content of the foo file.

The Right _Dockable Pane_, provided by this sample project and docked to the right _Docking Area_, shows the information 
of the currently selected sample.

The Bottom _Dockable Pane_, provided by this sample project and docked to the bottom _Docking Area_, provides a button which
creates background tasks and shows how to display them in the _Progress Monitor_.

The sample also provides a Top _Dockable Pane_, which is docked to the top_Docking Area_ and 
contains a Label showing Top respectivly. This _Dockable Pane_ is provided to make the corresponding 
_Docking Area_ visible.

See <<docking-framework.adoc#dockingFramework,Docking Framework>> for more information about the Docking Framework.

Let's continue with the Toolbars.

=== The Toolbars
Above the Content Pane you can find a Toolbar Container, which can contain any number of Toolbars. Currently three types 
of Toolbar buttons are supported: "normal" Toolbar buttons, toggle Toolbar buttons without a ToggleGroup and toggle 
Toolbar buttons within a ToggleGroup. The Toolbar Container is provided by _Drombler FX_.

An Action Framework keeps the state (enabled/ disabled, selected/ unselected etc.), the information (texts, image etc.) 
and the logic between Menu items and Toolbar buttons in sync.

Actions may be always enabled or only under certain conditions. 

The File Toolbar is a standard Toolbar and the "Save" and "Save All" Toolbar buttons are standard Toolbar buttons 
provided by _Drombler FX_. The "Save" Toolbar button is only enabled if the _currently selected_ _Dockable Pane_ 
contains something to save. The "Save All" Toolbar button is only enabled if _any_ _Dockable Pane_ contains something 
to save. E.g. the sample editor and the foo editor are marked as modified by default. You can see this as the save actions are enabled
and the text of the tab is in bold. If you save an Editor the "Save" button becomes disabled and the text of the tab is back to normal again. 
If you click on another modified _Dockable Pane_ the "Save" button gets enabled again. 
The "Save All" button, however, stays enabled as long as there is still a modified _Dockable Pane_ open.
Once a new sample gets saved, the name text field is not editable anymore.
For every saved Editor there is also a configured tooltip of the tab: for sample editors it's simply the name and for foo Editors it's the file path.
If you close an unsaved Editor or if you close the window/ application while there are still unsaved Editors open, the _Docking Framework_ detects this
and provides an according dialog.

image::getting-started/unsaved-editors-on-closing-window.png[caption="Image 2: ", title="Unsaved Editors on closing window - with 1 Sample Editor: 'Sample 1' and 1 Foo Editor: 'Untitled 3'", alt="Unsaved Editors on closing window - with 1 Sample Editor: 'Sample 1' and 1 Foo Editor: 'Untitled 3'", link="{imagesdir}/getting-started/unsaved-editors-on-closing-window.png"]

The Rectangle Toolbar, provided by the sample project, provides three toggle Toolbar buttons with colored rectanlge 
images. Since they don't belong to a toggle group any number of them may be selected. They are only enabled if the 
currently selected _Dockable Pane_ can manage colored rectangles - such as the Sample Editor.

The Circle Toolbar, also provided by the sample project, provides three toggle Toolbar buttons with colored circle 
images. Since they belong to a toggle group only one can be selected at a time. They are only enabled if the currently 
selected _Dockable Pane_ can manage a colored circle - such as the Sample Editor.

Note that the selection of the toggle buttons is _context sensitve_ as well. E.g. if you have two open Sample Editors 
you can have different selections for each of these editors. The buttons reflect the selection depending on the 
currently _active_ Sample Editor. When you select a _Dockable Pane_, which cannot manage colored circle/ rectangles, 
the corresponding buttons become unselected and disabled again.

Note that the Toolbar buttons have been configured with Tooltips (only visible if they are enabled).

Note: If you run the application with a German locale the texts provided by Drombler FX are shown in German.

See <<actions-menus-toolbars.adoc#actionsMenusToolbars,Actions, Menus and Toolbars>> for more information about Actions and Toolbars.

Let's continue with the Menus.

=== The Menus
At the top there is a Menu Bar provided by _Drombler FX_.

An Action Framework keeps the state (enabled/ disabled, selected/ unselected etc.), the information (texts, image etc.) 
and the logic between Menu items and Toolbar buttons in sync.

The File menu, which is a standard menu provided by _Drombler FX_, contains 

 * A New menu item, which opens a new "foo" document in an Editor. This custom menu item is provided by the sample.
 * 3 test menu items ("Test 1", "Test 2" and "Test 3), which simply write some text to the standard output. These are 
custom menu items provided by this sample.
 * A Open menu item, which provides a generic open file dialog and supports "foo" files. This is a standard menu item provided
by _Drombler FX_.
 * 2 Save menu items ("Save" and "Save All"). These are standard menu items provided by _Drombler FX_. They behave in 
the same way as the corresponding Toolbar buttons described above.
 * An Exit menu item, which properly shuts down the JavaFX Platform and the OSGi Platform. This is a standard menu item 
provided by _Drombler FX_
 * Some separators between some of the menu items.


The View menu contains a Toolbars menu, with a toggable menu item for each registered Toolbar. Here you can select which
 Toolbars should be visible. This is a standard feature of _Drombler FX_.

The Custom menu and its contents is provided by the sample. You can register any number of menu items and (possibly 
deeply nested) sub-menus. The Custom menu contains 3 rectangle actions and the Sub Menu contains 3 circle actions. 
They behave in the same way as the corresponding Toolbar buttons.

The Window menu contains a menu item for each registered _View_ to open them again. (_Views_ are treated as 
Singletons - there is only one instance per _View_ type.) The _View_ menu items can also be registered in some 
sub-menus. Here: the Right _View_ is registered in the _Others_ sub-menu. This is a standard feature provided 
by _Drombler FX_. See the _Content Pane_ section above for more information about the Docking Framework.

You could try and close one of the sample _Views_: Left, Right, Top or Bottom. Note that as they are closed the 
space of their parent _Docking Area_ is given to the other _Docking Areas_. If you click on the corresponding Window 
menu item the corresponding _Docking Area_ will get some space again and the _View_ is opened in that _Docking Area_.

The Help menu is also a standard menu provided by _Drombler FX_, but it is currently empty.

Note that most menu items have been configured with accelerator and mnemonic keys.

Note: If you run the application with a German locale the texts provided by _Drombler FX_ are shown in German.


See <<actions-menus-toolbars.adoc#actionsMenusToolbars,Actions, Menus and Toolbars>> for more information about Actions and Menus.

=== The Status Bar
The _Status Bar_ can be used to display some additional information to the user such as the current running, but cancelable background workers.

See <<status-bar.adoc#statusBar,Status Bar>> for more information about the Status Bar.

See <<progress-monitor.adoc#progressMonitor,Progress Monitor>> for more information about the Progress Monitor.

== Drombler FX Sample Application - the binaries explained

Let's have a look at the generated binaries.

You can find the binaries in the target directory of the test-application project at: *deployment/standalone*

In the *bin* directory you can find the executable main JAR: *my-application.jar* +
The JAR has been branded using the specified brandingId.

Let's have a look at the content of this JAR.

You can find:
 
 * META-INF/MANIFEST.MF: a Manifest file with the _Main-Class_ header and the _Class-Path_ header, which turns this main JAR into an executable JAR.
 * applicationConfig.properties: contains application configurations such as: title, width and height

In the *lib* directory you can find the JARs needed at start-up time to start a _Drombler FX_ application:

 * the *drombler-fx-startup-main* JAR: it contains the _JavaFX_ application main class and defines the _org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra_ property 
to make the _JavaFX_ packages and the _Drombler_ start-up packages available to the OSGi bundles.
 * the *drombler-acp-startup-main* JAR: it contains the GUI-toolkit agnostic start-up classes.
 * the *org.apache.felix.framework* JAR: the http://felix.apache.org[Apache Felix Framework], an implementation of the OSGi runtime framework.
 

In the *bundle* directory you can find all direct and transitive Maven dependencies with scope compile or test. The start-up classes will load these bundles.

The *conf* directory contains the files copied from */src/main/app*. The _Drombler FX Maven Plugin_ makes sure the property files for 
application and system properties exist and contain the necessary properties such as the default location of the user directory. +
The user may change their values here.

== Drombler FX Sample Application - the source code explained

You should see now a directory "test", with the following content:

 * pom.xml
 * test-application
 * test-foo
 * test-parent
 * test-sample


These are in fact 5 Maven projects. Let's have a look at them one by one.

=== The Multi-Module Project

The top-level project (the pom.xml in the test-directory) is a multi-module project. It's used to build all parts of 
your application with a single "mvn clean install".

=== The Drombler FX Application Project

The project in the test-application directory is the _Drombler FX Application_ project. Its Maven packaging type is 
"drombler-fx-application" and thus requires the _Drombler FX Maven Plugin_ "org.drombler.fx:drombler-fx-maven-plugin" 
as an extension. 

This project is used to:
 
 * configure the bundles your application is made of
 * provide additional resources
 * deploy them
 * run the application


In the _Drombler FX Maven Plugin_ configuration you can specify the brandingId and the application title, width and 
height.


NOTE: Currently you always need to rebuild this project if any of its bundles has changed!

The nbactions.xml enables the "Run Project" and "Debug Project" buttons in NetBeans for this project. You can have a 
look at it to see how to run and debug the application. You can delete this file if you use another IDE than NetBeans.

=== The Foo Project
It shows how to register support for "foo" files.

The foo project is a standard OSGi project. You can use org.apache.felix:maven-bundle-plugin as an extension plugin 
and the packaging type "bundle" to let Maven generate the OSGi Manifest entries for you (using a POM first approach).

The FooHandler is registered as a Document Handler for the MIME type "text/x-foo+xml". It knows how to load and write the content of "foo" files.

The package-info provides a file extension registration which associates the "foo" file extension with the "text/x-foo+xml" MIME type.

The FooEditorPane implements a _Dockable Pane_ which gets registered as an Editor for FooHandler. This sample code provides a simple TextArea to edit the
text of the foo files.

The NewAction implements an action which creates a new FooHandler and opens an Editor for this FooHandler.

=== The Parent Project

The parent project contains the parent POM used by the other projects of this sample.

Have a look at the comments in the POM for more information.

NOTE: I prefer to have the parent POM (used to inherit configurations) and the multi-module POM (used for 
reactor builds) in two separate POMs. If you prefer to use the multi-module POM as the parent POM, feel free to copy 
the content of the parent POM to the multi-module POM and to delete this parent POM.

=== The Sample Project

This is the project which provides the actual sample specific parts.

The sample project is a standard OSGi project. You can use org.apache.felix:maven-bundle-plugin as an extension plugin 
and the packaging type "bundle" to let Maven generate the OSGi Manifest entries for you (using a POM first approach).

Since part of modular programming is about keeping APIs private and not exporting them, it's a good practice to start 
adding classes to a private package such as: \*.impl.\* (the org.apache.felix:maven-bundle-plugin takes care that such 
packages stay private by default.)
Only classes which should be accessible by other bundles should be in exported packages.

So most classes are in the package: com.mycompany.test.sample.impl

In this package you can find the abstract toggle action classes AbstractColoredCircleAction and 
AbstractColoredRectangleAction, both implementing the interface ActiveContextSensitive to set their state depending on 
the content of the active Context. 

As you can see they are looking for instances of the interface ColoredCircleManager/ ColoredRectangleManager in the 
active context. They register a listener to get notified whenever the content of the active context changes. When the 
selection state of the toggle action changes, they call the corresponding methods of ColoredCircleManager/ 
ColoredRectangleManager. This is the mechanism to loosly couple Actions to other parts of the application: 
At one end a DockingPane in one bundle adds an instance of the required interface to its local context. 
The Action at the other end (and possibly in a different bundle) looks for instances of this interface in e.g. 
the active context. 

The BlueCircleAction, RedCircleAction and YellowCircleAction use annotations to register the toggle actions, 
the toggle menu entries and the toggle toolbar entries. Note that the toggle menu entries and the toggle toolbar entries
 specify the same toggleGroupId, which has the effect that only one of them can be selected at a time.

The BlueRectangleAction, RedRectangleAction and YellowRectangleAction also use annotations to register the toggle 
actions, the toggle menu entries and the toggle toolbar entries. Note that they don't specify a toggleGroupId, however, 
allowing them to be selected at the same time.

The actions Test1, Test2 and Test3 show 3 different ways to implement "normal" (non-toggle) actions.


The package-info uses some annotations to register additional menus and toolbars.

See <<actions-menus-toolbars.adoc#actionsMenusToolbars,Actions, Menus and Toolbars>> for more information about Actions, Menus and Toolbars.

The LeftTestPane is a _Dockable Pane_ using annotations to register itself as a view in the left _Docking Area_ and a 
corresponding menu item in the Window menu. The onNewSampleAction logic, which gets triggered when the "New Sample" button gets clicked, creates a new Sample and opens it in a new SampleEditorPane.

The SampleEditorPane is a _Dockable Pane_ using annotations to register itself as an Editor. It configures a writable local context and adds to it an instance of a custom implementation of 
ColoredCircleManager and ColoredRectangleManager to enable the colored circle and colored rectangle toolbar buttons and 
menu items. The SampleHandler instance gets automatically added to its implicit local context, so that other _Dockable Panes_ can look for it and display 
some information about it.

It configures the controls from the values of the properties of the Sample.

Whenever the content of the SampleEditorPane changes the method markModified() gets called to add an instance of a 
Sample specific implementation of the Save interface to its local context to enable the "Save" and "Save All" Actions. 
If one of the Save toolbar buttons or menu items get clicked, the method save() of the private class SampleSavable gets 
called. It updates the Sample properties and removes itself from the local context to disable the Save actions. 
A real application would probably also call some methods here to make the changes persistent.
Note: Since this SampleEditorPane updates the properties of the sample only when the sample gets saved, 
other _Dockable Panes_ such as RightTestPane are only updated once one of the Save toolbar buttons or menu items gets 
clicked!


The RightTestPane is a _Dockable Pane_ using annotations to register itself as a view in the right _Docking Area_ and a 
corresponding menu item in the Window/Other sub-menu. It implements ActiveContextSensitive to look for a Sample instance in the active context. 
If it finds one, it shows the properties of the sample. Note that it also configures a writable local context and adds the found SampleHandler object to it. 
This has the effect that you can click on the RightTestPane and it continues to display the properties of the SampleHandler.



The TopTestPane and the BottomTestPane are _Dockable Panes_ using annotations to register themselves as a view in the 
top/ bottom _Docking Area_ and a corresponding menu item in the Window menu.

The DockingPanes look for a FXML file with the same name in the same package, e.g. LeftTestPane looks for 
LeftTestPane.fxml. This is a convention of _Drombler FX_. (The FXML files are in the resource directory.)


Note that the classes ColoredCircle, ColoredCircleManager, ColoredRectangle and ColoredRectangleManager are in the 
package com.mycompany.test.sample, which is an exported package (have a look at the generated Manifest file). 
This means that other bundles can use these classes to interact with the colored circle and rectangle actions, 
toolbar buttons and menu items. The same is true for the Sample and the SampleHandler classes: since they are in the exported package, 
Views in other bundles can look for them in e.g. the active context.

See <<docking-framework.adoc#dockingFramework,Docking Framework>> for more information about the Docking Framework.

See <<context-framework.adoc#contextFramework,Context Framework>> for more information about the Context Framework.

The localized texts are expected to be  specified in the Bundle.properties file (or a locale specific derivation of 
this file) in the same package as the annotated class in question. This is a convention of _Drombler FX_.


See <<localization.adoc#localization,Localization>> for more information about localizing _Drombler FX_ applications.

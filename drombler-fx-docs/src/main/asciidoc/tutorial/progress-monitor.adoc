This section describes the progress monitor support.

_Drombler FX_ provides out-of-the-box support for monitoring long-running
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/concurrent/Worker.html[Worker]s by integrating a progress monitor in 
the <<status-bar.adoc#statusBar,Status Bar>>.

This feature is optional and must be activated if required.

[[activation]]
== Activation
To activate the progress monitor integration in the <<status-bar.adoc#statusBar,Status Bar>> you need the following additional runtime dependency in your application:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.drombler.fx</groupId>
    <artifactId>drombler-fx-core-standard-status</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

[[notification]]
== Notification
The progress monitor integration listens for any non-finished http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/concurrent/Worker.html[Worker] instances in the 
<<context-framework.adoc#applicationContext,application-wide>> context.

To notify the progress monitor about the availability of a new Worker instance, simply add it to
the <<context-framework.adoc#localContext,local context>> of a _Dromber FX_ managed component:

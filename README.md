Drombler FX
===========

The modular application framework for *JavaFX* based on:

 - **OSGi**: *OSGi* is the de facto standard for writing modular software in *Java*.

 - **Maven (POM-first)**: *Drombler FX* applications can be build with *Maven*. The build follows the standard POM-first approach (the OSGi meta data will be generated for you). A custom Maven Plugin will help you to easily create *JavaFX* applications with Maven. A custom Maven Archetype will help you to get started.

- **Declarative programming model**: Annotations can be used at many places to register elements such as menus, toolbars and GUI components.

- **Drombler ACP**: *Drombler FX* is a *JavaFX* specific extension for *Drombler ACP* providing *JavaFX*-based implementations for the abstract definitions. Read more about *Drombler ACP* here: [Drombler ACP](../drombler-acp)

- **Drombler Commons**: *Drombler Commons* is a collection of reusable libraries and frameworks. They ship with *OSGi* meta data but donâ€™t require an *OSGi* environment. Read more about *Drombler Commons* here: [Drombler Commons](../drombler-commons)

*Drombler FX* uses [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org) as its OSGi container by default.

As an application framework it makes sure *JavaFX* and *OSGi* will get started properly and it provides the main window.

See the [documentation](https://www.drombler.org/drombler-fx) for a tutorial, the Javadoc and information about the available Maven modules (available from Maven Central).
